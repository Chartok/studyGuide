# studyGuide Notes

## Description

The studyGuide Notes webpage was created following along bootcamp prework course. 

While going through the course I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As well as using GitHub and Git Bash to manage this project.

The webpage is a novel tool in that there will still be something in it that will teach me 5 years later.
