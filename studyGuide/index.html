        <h3>Notes on HTML</h3>
        <ul>
          <div>
            <li>Element refers to the opening and closing tag.</li>
            <li>The tag refers to the text inside the angle brackets</li>
            <li>Not all elements have a closing tag and are known as self-closing tags</li>
            <li>A closing tag begins with a /</li>
            <li>The browser interperets the content between the opening and closing tags based on the tag name</li>
            <li>HTML attributes defined in the beginning of the opening tag of an element provides additional information about the element</li>
            <li>Elements nested in other elements are called child elements.</li>
            <li>The element that holds child elements is known as the parent element.</li>
            <li>The header appears at the top and usually contains navigation menu and perhaps even introductory content.</li>
            <li>The footer appears at the bottom of the page and sometimes contains the author, copyright, contact, and more.</li>
           <li> Not all elements are semantic; div creates a division in the webpage, span creates an inline division.</li>
           <li>The !DOCTYPE html declares to the browser the document type is html.</li>
           <li>Best practice to use semantic elements when possible, especially when visible to users.</li>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
          <li>The head element contains metadata that web browsers use to bring the webpage to the user.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines the metadata such as: character set, description, keywords, and more.</li>
          <li>The attribute charset="UTF-8" sets the character set to UTF-8 that allows the use of most characters and symbols.</li>
          <li>The lang="en" attribute inside the html opening tag tells the browser the language for the webpage.</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The viewport attribute sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element defines and sets the title of the webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The h1-h6 elements refer to the heading level of the associated text block. The h1 heading element should only be used once on each webpage</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text, and is used to wrap most of the text on webpages.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. Used for bulleted or numbered lists</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. It can contain various attributes, src attribute defines the location and source of the image, and the alt attribute describes the appearance and functionality of the image and used for accessability </li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break between two content blocks.</li>
          <li>The a element creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
